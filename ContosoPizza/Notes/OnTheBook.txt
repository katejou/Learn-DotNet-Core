[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class WeatherForecastController : ControllerBase

- ControllerBase :
The first thing to notice is that this class inherits from the ControllerBase base class. 
This base class provides a lot of standard functionality for handling HTTP requests, 
so you can focus on the specific business logic for your application.

- [ApiController] :
enables opinionated behaviors that make it easier to build web APIs. 
Some behaviors include parameter source inference, attribute routing as a requirement, 
and model validation error-handling enhancements.

- [Route] : 
defines the routing pattern [controller]. 
The [controller] token is replaced by the controller's name (case-insensitive, without the Controller suffix).

    [HttpGet(Name = "GetWeatherForecast")] <--
    public IEnumerable<WeatherForecast> Get()
<--
This attribute routes HTTP GET requests to the public IEnumerable<WeatherForecast> Get() method.

    [HttpGet("{id}")]

You can implement another GET action that requires an id parameter.
The routing logic registers [HttpGet] (without id) and [HttpGet("{id}")] (with id) as two different routes.
You can then write a separate action to retrieve a single item.

    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult Create(Pizza pizza)

IActionResult :
lets the client know if the request succeeded and provides the ID of the newly created pizza. 
IActionResult does this by using standard HTTP status codes
CreatedAtAction 201	The pizza was added to the in-memory cache.
BadRequest      400	The request body's pizza object is invalid.

    [HttpPut("{id}")]
    public IActionResult Update(int id, Pizza pizza)

NoContent   204	The pizza was updated in the in-memory cache.
BadRequest	400	The request body's Id value doesn't match the route's id value.
BadRequest  400	The request body's Pizza object is invalid.

    [HttpDelete("{id}")]
    public IActionResult Delete(int id)
    
NoContent	204	The pizza was deleted from the in-memory cache.
NotFound	404	A pizza that matches the provided id parameter doesn't exist in the in-memory cache.
